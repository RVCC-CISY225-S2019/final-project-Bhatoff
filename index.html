        <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
        <div class='story-body'>
       <p>“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, 
           “because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; 
           and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance 
           long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally 
           professing opinions which in fact are not your own.”</p>
       <br>
       <p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, 
           “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. 
           I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, 
           in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. 
           Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in 
           Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, 
           and such things may come out as will shock your relations to  hear.”</p>
       <br>
       <p>“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.</p>
       <br>
       <p>“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. 
           “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”</p>
       <br>
       <p>“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. 
           The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, 
           what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, 
           though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, 
           more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, 
          Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; 
          but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. 
          “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, 
          is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to him. 
          It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy, 
          “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, 
          or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this 
          instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. 
          They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. 
          But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault-
          -because I will not take the trouble of practising. 
          It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. 
          No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. 
          We neither of us perform to strangers.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. 
          Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, 
          and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, 
          and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, 
          though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, 
          had her health allowed her to learn.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he 
          assented to his cousin’s praise; but neither at that 
          moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; 
          and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this 
          comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as 
          likely to marry her, had she been his relation.</p>

<p style="cursor: grab">div {

              }</p>

<p>Grabbing: This cursor shows a fist grabbing and indicates something can be grabbed.</p>

   <p style="cursor: grabbing">div {
    cursor:auto;
              }</p>
<p>Image: Make the cursor an image of your choice.</p>
